Project Breakdown

Problem Statement:
In today's world, a majority of people dedicate their time to stuff like gaming, social media, and watching Netflix series, anime, and kdrama and they aren't productive even though they should be and have the potential to be productive. While doing any of the previously mentioned activities isn't a bad thing, there should be a limit to how much time you dedicate your time to it. People should also develop good habits like drinking water regularly, exercising, reading books, meditating and even learning a new hobby.

Why Choose Faico?
The meaning of Faico in Latin is "I Do".Faico is a dapp where a user can dictate what they should do in a day and reward them with NFT for every day successfully done. They will be rewarded different tiers of NFT based on how accurately have they achieved what they want to achieve, if they achieve 50% of their goals and do all the goals which are marked important, they will be given a bronze NFT. If they did above 70% they would get a silver NFT and if they did above 80% of the goals would get a gold NFT and if they did 100% of their goals, they would get a diamond NFT and those who didn't achieve more than 50% of goals or don't the important tasks will be given a meme nft to encourage them to do better next time. The bronze, silver, and gold nft can be obtained only if they succeed do the important task. They will be a leaderboard for the most diamond NFT, most points and most meme NFT. The app will also include reminders to drink water every day and to trigger the start of a Pomodoro technique.
